## Agent Based Modeling Assignments

# Path Between Homes
Here is [my first assignment](https://rpubs.com/mabuch/651829) where I plot a possible route between homes on a simple 2D axis.

# Liberia + Gabon Shp
Liberia and Gabon shapefiles converted into [two maps](https://rpubs.com/mabuch/652850) through R/Rstudio

# Gabon Counties
Gabon County populations represented with color gradients [here](https://rpubs.com/mabuch/653485)

# Project 1: Pop Density of Gabon and Subdivisions
Gabon counties with population data represented with a [bar plot and map](https://rpubs.com/mabuch/659187)

# Project 1: Urban Areas within a selected administrative boundary
[Woleu, Woleu-Ntem in Gabon](https://rpubs.com/mabuch/662233) is my selected area in which I define urban areas not provided in our GADM data

# Data Science Insight 1
This paper is an interesting piece that was published in 2016 [(Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference
H. Yang, Z. Kong, and MD Sarder, eds)](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/46104226/FinalPaper_1446.pdf?1464719223=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DAn_Agent_Based_Approach_for_Understandin.pdf&Expires=1600438398&Signature=GfgQVlJDQQUrGEQAeb2UajwZWOF4O7fb2j07z~3xMprSAdEMYG1tf1Fmti8ztrt472BqELadKOia9VgDV4HyeMaPA6Yss3kOms93IsMzBSZcT4mfCXNSrposkefP44OCKeaDr7NCxvyx3h4qdfdWPSdU9sjyN4Qj5nuhDY46xXhLDh6o51amk0Snpv-fv1LgDw-FU5yGkAXTLGZuf8BN37RXbYSK3a-zezyjiXlYhcyO-de~CVNJGSdG8fHkslwlbQcLjpMuJSTF0uMOGtZc6Rw0-cUbo-ZmK1lVEMAMeWVUK4gD2vtgZ7VfZi7Jt~f8dpz40NgOVmad9G4ZsIPX3w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA). The model displays the likelihood of a terrorist attack in a given area and the interactions between terrorist groups that affects future activity.

# Data Science Insight 2
This paper, coincidentally, was also published in 2016. Titled [Multi-Agent Based Modeling for Electric Vehicle Integration in a Distribution Network Integration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037877961630061X), it describes an agent-based modeling approach to meet energy demand as the number of electric vehicles on the road increases. My insight into this article is published [here](https://rpubs.com/mabuch/676412).

# Project 2: Generated Synthetic Populations
The country of Gabon [analyzed](https://rpubs.com/mabuch/683877) at the adm0 and adm2 locations, specefying at Woleu in Woleu-Ntem, Gabon.

# Data Science Insight 3:
[This](https://rpubs.com/mabuch/683902) Data Science Insight pertains to the Zhenhua data leak where a database with over 2 million people and their sensitive information was found.
